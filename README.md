# House-Price-Prediction-Model-Deployment-with-AWS
In this project, I'm predicting house prices with advanced Regression Machine Learning algorithms using a "house_data" dataset from Kaggle. Deploying this house price prediction machine learning model on an Amazon EC2 instance which makes the model accessible and scalable for real-time prediction queries.
